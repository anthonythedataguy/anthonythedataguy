# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony, the data guy

I'm currently a Manager of Information Systems but I've been a Data Engineer and Architect for the past 10 years. Most of my experience has been with SQL but I also work with Python and Power BI. I enjoy working on data projects and architecting solutions using cloud platforms like Azure and AWS. I'm an analyst and enjoy putting technology in place to help my users so I spend quite a bit of time learning cloud solutions and machine learning.

When not working or studying I'm a dad, DIYer and outdoors enthusiast. You can find me playing with my daughter, making changes around the house or far from reception.
